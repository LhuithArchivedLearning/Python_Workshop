# Temperature conversion
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, denoting a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit

fahrenheit = 98.6 # degrees

# Write a Python expression to calculate the temperature in Celsius
# and print the result in a message to the screen.
#
# HINT: Given a temperature F in degrees Fahrenheit the equivalent
# temperature C in degrees Celsius is (F - 32) * (5 / 9).


print((fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9));
