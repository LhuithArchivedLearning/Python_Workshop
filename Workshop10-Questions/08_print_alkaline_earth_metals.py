# Print alkaline earth metals
#
# In this exercise you will develop a Python program that
# accesses an SQLite database.  We assume that you have
# already loaded a version of the Elements database using
# the a graphical user interface.  You can do so by executing
# the elements.sql script provided.  (This database is
# slightly different than the one used in last week's
# workshop.  You may see some dubious looking data in this
# database!  If this worries you, do the "Delete elements"
# exercise!)
#
# Your tasks:
#
# 1) Browse the database's contents in an interactive interface
# to ensure that you're familiar with its two tables and
# their columns.
#
# 2) Write a Python program to print the names of the "alkaline
# earth metals".  These are the elements with atomic numbers
# 4, 12 and 20 in our small database.

# Import the SQLite functions
from sqlite3 import *

## DEVELOP YOUR PROGRAM HERE BY REPLACING EACH OF THE 'pass'
## STATEMENTS BELOW (WHICH DO NOTHING) WITH THE NECESSARY CODE

# 1. Make a connection to the elements database
pass

# 2. Get a cursor on the database
pass

# 3. Construct the SQLite query
pass

# 4. Execute the query
pass

# 5. Get the result set and print it out
pass

# 6. Close the cursor and connection
pass
